          <h3>Objectives</h3>
		      <p>Our main goal was to create a cute and interactive robot that dances in reaction to facial expressions and to integrate facial recognition to detect basic emotions.  Our minimum viable product for demo day is to create a robot that demonstrates three different dances and that people would be able to interact with.</p>

          <h3>Inspiration</h3>
          <p>Fundamentally, we wanted to create a robot that would dance in reaction to facial expressions.  There are several routes that we could have taken such as creating a humanoid robot or just the upper body to limit the degrees of freedom.  However, we decided that creating an adorable, non-human robot would appeal to a wider audience because of the added emotional attachment.  As a result, we researched dancing robots such as Hexy, Keepon, and solar powered dancing flowers for inspiration.  We decided on using Keepon for our main inspiration because it had four degrees of a freedom that we could use as a reference.  We were able to borrow a Keepon from the Olin Robotics Lab which we took apart to study its mechanisms.  As we progressed through the project, we have incorporated our own mechanisms, dances, and motions that have improved or changed the Keeponâ€™s original design to match our needs.</p>

          <h3>Aesthetic</h3>
          <p>Our vision shifted from initially having the covering of the stick be Olaf from the Disney movie Frozen. The doll we ordered was much smaller and stiffer than expected or desired, so we took a trip to the toy store and bought a fuzzy penguin stuffed animal, allowing us to ensure the dimensions and flexibility of the fabric, as well as keeping the cute factor.</p>
