          <h2>Integration</h2>
			<h3>Iteration 4</h3>
			  <p>In order to run the fourth iteration, a lot of firmware and software must be installed.
			  This includes ROS (Robot Operating System), GStreamer, and pulling from specific GitHub
			  repositories. The complete details can be found <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/comprobofall14/home/howto/setting-up-your-environment">here</a>.
              <p>In the fourth and last integration iteration, the Raspberry Pi sends over the video stream
              via GStreamer to a laptop that then runs the classification algorithms on the video frames.
              The Raspberry Pi is also set up to be a server and receives information about the
              classification of each frame.</p>
              <p>The laptop launches the interface between GStreamer and ROS which converts the video
              stream sent from the Raspberry Pi to ROS topics. Then, using a Python package called
              CV Bridge, the laptop would then "decode" each image into OpenCV objects that could then
              be classified. Once classified, the laptop also acts as a client and sends the
              classification information over to the Raspberry Pi (whether or not there are faces and
              if any of the faces are smiling).</p>
              <h3>Iteration 3</h3>
              <p>In the third integration iteration, the Raspberry Pi recorded the video stream from
              the on-board Pi Camera module and detected faces and smiles from the video stream.
              We utilized Python's built-in multi-threading capabilities. However, the Raspberry Pi
              only has one core, so the multi-threading devolved into a very advanced instruction
              scheduler. This forced the Raspberry Pi to either record video or classify the frames,
              but not both at the same time because of the limits of Raspberry Pi's computing capabilities.</p>
			  <h3>Iteration 1 and 2</h3>
		      <p>In the first and second integration sessions, the Raspberry Pi was not used.
              We did not expect to be able to integrate the Raspberry Pi into a portable
              scheme. We simply used PySerial to communicate between the Arduino and the computer.
			  There were minor glitches, including the fact that the data is sent over as Strings
			  to the Arduino. This prevents the direct comparison between the integer finite states.
			  Instead, we converted the integer finite states to be integers type-casted to Strings
			  for comparison.</p>
