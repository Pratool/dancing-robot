          <h3>Design Phases</h3>

<p>We had many different ideas and different input on how to replicate the Keepon motions. We eventually figured that we needed three types of motions. We then came up with various mechanical designs for these three types of motions.

<div style="position: relative; top: -250px; left: 260px; width: 300px">To avoid using three separate motors, we tried to replicate a side-to-side and up-down motion by combining mechanisms on one motor. This had several obvious flaws after further investigation.</div>
<div style="position: relative; top: -140px"><img src='images/scan02.png' width='300px'></div>
<div style="position: relative; top: -350px; left: 310px; width: 250px;">We looked into having a cam sliding mechanism that would allow rotation at different rates at different positions of the motor. We ditched the idea after it became clear the successfully implementating the cam slider would be difficult to implement and because better ideas came about.</div>

<div style="position: relative; top: -330px;">We came up with a mechanism that would allow for an up-down movement. However, we weren't sure if a spring loaded pin would add structural integrity without ruining the motion. We eventually replaced this idea with telescoping pipes, which did the same thing.</div>

<div style="position: relative; top: -325px"><h3>First Iteration</h3></div>
<div style="position: relative; top: -325px"><img src="images/iteration01-1.png" width="340px"><span style="position: relative; left: 10px"><img src="images/iteration01-2.png" width="340px"></span></div>
<div style="position: relative; top: -325px">This purpose of this iteration was to explore the potential of different mechanisms. This iteration was made of cardboard (and duct tape) and contained two servos (not in the picture) that were held in the small rectangular piece seen in Figure 2 and in a similar part that canâ€™t be seen. The vision for this iteration was to have four degrees of freedom: Pitch, Roll, Yaw, and Heave. Only the mechanisms for Pitch, Yaw and Heave are included in this model. 
The hook seen in Figure 1 was intended to be connected to the head of the robot in some way in order to provide Pitch, however due to this iteration we were able to determine that this mechanism would not work for our purposes. Additionally, the circle seen in Figure 2 is part of a crank slider assembly to provide Yaw (primarily) and Heave (consequentially). We decided to abandon both mechanisms for our next iteration.</div>

<div style="position: relative; top: -300px"><h3>Second Iteration</h3></div>
<div style="position: relative; top: -300px"><img src="images/iteration02-1.png" width="340px">
<span style="position: relative; left: 10px"><img src="images/iteration02-2.png" width="340px"></span></div>
<div style="position: relative; top: -300px">
<p>Taking what we learned from Iteration 1, we completely redesigned our mechanisms. For this iteration, we also decided to drop a degree of freedom, deciding that Pitch was not an important enough motion for our dancing robot, especially with time constraints. This iteration is made of MDF and brass and aluminum tubes.</p>
<p>This iteration has three servos: one at the bottom providing Roll by rotating the entire upper assembly, one in the middle driving a scotch yoke to provide Heave, and one at the top providing Yaw.</p>
<p>Once again, this iteration taught us a lot about how to improve the design. For starters, the brass and aluminum tubes used to guide and support the Heave motion did not slide as smoothly as desired, so we decided to abandon the telescoping aspect, and instead use nylon spacers and a single aluminum tube. Secondly, the holes to hold the tubes were too close to the edge of the MDF platforms, causing the corners to split and the integrity of the design to be compromised. To address this in the next iteration, we made the platforms a bit larger and the hole pattern smaller. </p>
<p>Next, the base holding the bottom servo was not intended for this project, but was handily available from a lab earlier in the semester. Therefore, the center of rotation of the bottom servo was not centered on the platform, leading to instability. Also, the square piece of MDF with the large circle in the center that is not doing anything was intended to support the lower platform, minimizing cross-forces on the bottom servo, allowing the maximum power and torque to go into the rotational motion desired. However, this was not implemented due to the base and the protrusion of the rods below the surface of the MDF platform. The base for the next iteration was designed for the purpose of this project and is much more stable and integratable with the support.</p>
<p>We decided to make the wheel and yoke of the scotch yoke assembly out of delrin to reduce friction, as these surfaces slide together.<p>
<p>Finally, the upper servo, merely taped to the platform in this iteration, was mounted in an MDF support in the final iteration to provide stability.</p></div>
